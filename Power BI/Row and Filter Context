Row context exists when DAX is evaluating one row at a time. eg : Calculated columns, Iterators: SUMX, FILTER, AVERAGEX, Table visuals (each row = one evaluation)

calculated column : Total_cost= Sale[Unit_SP]*Sale[Vol] , Total_cost will be produced for each row

Interestingly Measures are always evaluated in filter context, never row context, it works on aggregation, hence Total_cost= Sale[Unit_SP]*Sale[Vol] gives error for measure.
Hence Iterators like SUMX, FILTER, AVERAGEX are used. eg Total_cost= SUMX(Sale, Sale[Unit_SP]*Sale[Vol])

Filter Context exist in every operation by default in Power BI. It defines which rows of a table are included in a calculation or need to be filtered out.
Eg : Visuals (slicers, filters), Relationships, CALCULATE, ALL, REMOVEFILTERS, Page / report filters.

CALCULATE evaluates an expression after modifying the filter context.  
Performs context transition -> CALCULATE converts existing row context into filter context.
Context transition only happens when CALCULATE is used inside a row context (like iterators or calculated columns)

eg: 
Top 80% Revenue =
CALCULATE(
    [Total Revenue],
    FILTER(
        ALL(Customers),
        [Cumulative Revenue %] <= 0.8
    )
)

1️⃣ Why does this work in a table -
Table Visual Provides row context and Measure evaluated once per row
In a table: Each row = one customer
[Cumulative Revenue %] can be evaluated per customer
FILTER condition makes sense

2️⃣ Why does it return BLANK in a card

In a card: No row context, FILTER iterates customers
[Cumulative Revenue %] needs row context, No context transition happens automatically

Result:
❌ Filter condition cannot resolve
❌ Measure returns BLANK

3️⃣ How do you fix it properly
Top 80% Revenue =
//explicitly defining a customer table that calculates revenue per customer
VAR CustomerTable =
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        ALL(Customers),
        "CustomerRevenue", [Total Revenue]
    )

//cumulative contribution using iterator functions like ADDCOLUMNS and SUMX.
VAR RankedCustomers =
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        CustomerTable,
        "CumulativeRevenuePct",
        DIVIDE(
            SUMX(
                FILTER(
                    CustomerTable,
                    [CustomerRevenue] >= EARLIER([CustomerRevenue])
                ),
                [CustomerRevenue]
            ),
            SUMX(CustomerTable, [CustomerRevenue])
        )
    )

RETURN
SUMX(
    FILTER(
        RankedCustomers,
        [CumulativeRevenuePct] <= 0.8
    ),
    [CustomerRevenue]
)

other examples of filter context:
ALL vs ALLSELECTED vs REMOVEFILTERS

ALL(Date) -  Removes all filters on Date, including slicers, page filters, and visual filters.
ALLSELECTED(Date) - Removes visual-level filters, but keeps user selections (slicers, page filters). ALLSELECTED respects user intent
REMOVEFILTERS(Date) - Functionally similar to ALL, but clearer semantically.
