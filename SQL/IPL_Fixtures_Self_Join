You’re given a table of teams and asked to schedule fixtures between every pair of teams (round-robin), without duplicates or self-matches.
TEAM
----
CSK
MI
RCB
KKR

hence, the contraints are:
Every team plays every other team once
No team plays itself
No duplicate fixtures
(CSK vs MI is same as MI vs CSK → show only one)


SELECT
    t1.team AS team_1,
    t2.team AS team_2
FROM teams t1 --a self join creates cartesian product
JOIN teams t2
    ON t1.team < t2.team --the letters c,m,r and k are getting compared
ORDER BY team_1, team_2;

home	away	
csk	csk	csk>csk
csk	rcb	c>r
csk	mi	c>m
csk	kkr	c>k
rcb	csk	r>c
rcb	rcb	r>r
rcb	mi	r>m
rcb	kkr	r>k
mi	csk	m>c
mi	rcb	m>r
mi	mi	m>m
mi	kkr	m>k
kkr	csk	k>c
kkr	rcb	k>r
kkr	mi	k>m
kkr	kkr	k>k

for even home matches, then the only condiction is team 1 <>team 2
